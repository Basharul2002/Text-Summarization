Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, decision-making, speech recognition, and visual perception. AI operates through algorithms and machine learning models that enable machines to learn from data, adapt to new inputs, and improve performance over time. It is revolutionizing industries like healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment by automating processes, providing insights, and enhancing efficiency. As AI continues to evolve, its potential to transform the way we live and work grows exponentially.
